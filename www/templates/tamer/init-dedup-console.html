            <h4>To help jump-start the de-duplication model, would you suggest attributes that are especially useful for finding duplicates?</h4>
            <div class="row">
                <span>[X]</span>
                <select name="important-0">

                <span>is an important attribute, because it is:
                    <input type="checkbox" class="unique"> Unique
                    <input type="checkbox" class="unique"> Reliable
                </span>

                </label>

            </div>
            <div class="muted">
                <span>Note:  Important attributes are ones that are either mostly <em>unique</em>, i.e., only duplicate records would share a value in them, or mostly <em>reliable</em>, i.e., duplicate records should almost always share a value in the attribute.  An example of a <em>unique</em> attribute is the <em>latitude</em>e of a specific <em>place</em>.  An example of a <em>reliable</em> attribute is the <em>gender</em> of a <em>person</em>.  <em>Reliable</em> attributes have relatively clean, high quality data.</span>
