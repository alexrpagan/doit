	    Below, you will be shown pairs of data attributes. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="lead">
	  These are mappings which have been automatically generated between assay data attributes and attributes in a global schema by an ensemble of schema matching algorithms. The matches shown below are those rated 'most similar' by our algorithms. 
	  </p>
	  <p class="lead">
	    We need your help to determine whether these matches are correct!

	    What you do:
	  </p>
	  <ul class="instructions">
	    <li>
	      You will evaluate groups of 10 matches at a time. If you have been assigned more than 10 matches, then the next batch will appear when your answers have been saved.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Indicate whether you believe the pair <b>is</b> or <b>isn't</b> a match by pressing the <i class="icon-search icon-ok"></i> or <i class="icon-search icon-remove"></i> button. 
	      <div class="alert nb alert-info">
		<b>NB:</b> You may not always be able to determine whether or not the pair is a match. This is <b>OK</b>. Just give your best guess and indicate how sure you are using the confidence slider that appears after you make a decision.
	      </div>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      If you change your mind, you can use the <i class="icon-search icon-refresh"></i> button to reset the match to what we originally suggested. 
	      <div class="alert nb alert-info">
		<b>NB:</b> After you press "Save" your answer is final!

	    <dd>
	      The colored block between the assay attribute and the global attribute represents our algorithms' estimation of match strength. <span class="label label-success">Green</span> indicates a strong match and <span class="label label-important">Red</span> indicates a weak match.
